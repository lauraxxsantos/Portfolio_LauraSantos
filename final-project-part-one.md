# Outline
In this project I will conduct a research analysis on emergency preparedness in the United States. Our World in Data site showed that natural disasters are increasing (Ritchie, 2022). It is vital that people across all communities, especially the most vulnerable are prepared for a disaster. In my project, I will share information on emergency preparedness across households with a disability status, low-income households, and households whose main language is spanish. 

> A project structure that outlines the major elements of your story.  Your Good Charts text talks about story structure in Chapter 8 - you should describe what you hope to achieve.  Make sure the outline is detailed enough that we can see how you anticipate your story unfolding.  You can incorporate your Story Arc from the in-class exercise along with your user stories and one sentence summary to make the topic even more clear.

## Initial sketches
> Post images of your anticipated data visualizations (sketches are fine). They should mimic aspects of your outline, and include elements of your story.  



# The data
 
Our World in Data: 
Natural Disasters
https://ourworldindata.org/natural-disasters
This data set will be used to provide an overview of natural disasters in the United States over the last four decades 90s to 2020s
It will show how each natural diaster has trended overtime
This dataset provides information on deaths by natural disaster. A map on fatalities will be created. 
The dataset also provides information on the number of people affected and inurey by disaster. A chart will also be created on that. 

FEMA:
National Household Survey 2023
https://www.fema.gov/about/openfema/data-sets/national-household-survey 
- This is a survey dataset that provides information on how well households are prepared for a disaster. It has information for coastal flooding, riverine flooding, earthquake, hurricane, wildfires, and radiological emergencies. 
- The dataset includes demographic data for each household. For my research project I will create visuals that compare preparedness across household disability status, main household language, income, and race/ethnicity. 

Census Data: 
American Community Survey 5-Year Data (2009-2022) 
https://www.census.gov/data/developers/data-sets/acs-5year.html 
- I am going to overlap census tract income averages with locations of natural disasters. 
- Depending on other findings in the data I will pull other ACS 5-year estimate data to provide a further analysis on emergency preparedness



# Method and medium
The data analysis of this project will be completed using R, GIS, Tableau, and possibly online visualization tools. The story will be told using the shorthand platform. In the presentation you will see varying charts and maps when appropriate.
