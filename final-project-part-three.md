# 1-Minute Script 
Before I begin, I want to set the stage. I am a FEMA data analyst, and you are FEMA board members. 

Good afternoon everyone, 

Emergency Declarations: 
Over the last decade, we have seen an increase in FEMA emergency declarations for Hurricanes.  This chart shows that in 2017 alone, there were 2.3 million hurricane declarations. 

With Hurricane season upon us we need to be strategic in our aid approach. 

Case Study: Hurricane Harvey

As seen with Hurricane Harvey. A natural disaster exacerbates the vulnerability of already at-risk populations.
1. Hurricane Harvey increased the homeless population. 
2. Hurricane Harvey led to 125 Billion in damages

Could Texas communities have been more prepared? 

Preparedness: 
Well, our recent FEMA household survey revealed that emergency preparedness gaps are driven by household characteristics such as income and education. 

In this visual, we can see how the number of prepared households increases as income increases. Financially strained households do not have the means to purchase emergency supplies. 


To further drive the point that income is the driving factor. We found that Households with Disability are more likely to be prepared for a natural disaster, but when income is considered, low-income households with disabilities are less prepared. 


Call to action:

A household being prepared can mitigate the effects of being impacted by a natural disaster. 

FEMA could address this problem in 3 ways: increase awareness on being adequately prepared through social media campaigns, host supply drives before seasonal disasters, and provide grants to vulnerable communities to develop programs for their context. 


# Changes made since Part II
In phase II I was still deciding on the storyline. My original story line was to focus on all natural disasters in the U.S. After feedback from classmates and the course Professor, I was advised that I could tell a stronger story if I focused more in on the topic. From the data I saw that hurricanes have the most FEMA emergency declarations. It is also known that one Hurricane can cause great damage to a region. The class TA also suggested I focus on a case study for my storyline and specified that Harvey would be a good option. 

## To help me organize my story I used the following logical philosophical argumentation:

**1. We must agree this thing exists**

This involves establishing the existence of the concept or phenomenon being discussed.


**2. We need to agree on the definition**
After acknowledging its existence, all parties must agree on what the concept means.
We need to decide the value

**3. We need to decide the value**
Once defined, the importance, relevance, or value of the concept should be established.

**4. We must decide how to act or what conclusions to draw**

After agreeing on the existence, definition, and value, the next step is to determine the course of action, implications, or conclusions based on the agreed-upon understanding.

## The audience
> Talk about who you identified as the audience for your final data story.  Include any other information you've used that helped you narrow the focus (e.g. insights from your interviews, personas, etc.).  Note any specific adjustments you made to your final project to make it work for your audience.

# Setting the Stage:
As an aspiring data analyst for disaster management I decided to use my 1-minute presentation to pretend (manifest)to be a FEMA data analyst and be speaking to FEMA board members. In my career I will likely be presenting an analysis to stakeholders about the results from surveys or other reports. 

This argumentation approach helped me organize my story line. I was not sure if I should present the information on preparedness before or after the hurricane data. I learned this from meeting with the communication center at CMU. 



## Final design decisions
> You can specifically break out your design decisions here, or include it under *Changes made since Part II* and delete this section. Talk about the design decisions you had to make along the way, and reflect on anything in particular that stands out to you that you learned working through the process.  Include any other information that helps round out your data story. 

**Visual 1:** FEMA Declarations Per Disaster Type

The FEMA declarations visual shows the amount of declaration made by FEMA in a year per disaster type. FEMA Declarations designate an area as eligible for federal disaster assistance after a disaster. 

I orginally was going to do 2014 to 2024 but there was no hurricane data from 2013 to 2014. This meant that the hurricane trend line started in 2015. I thought this would be confusing. I decided to start the data at a year where there was data for all trend lines. 


**Visual 2:** United States' Costliest Hurricanes 

For this visual I took a makeover monday approach. One of the articles I read had a bar chart on hurricane damage costs. I thought this data was important in telling the story " Household Unpreparedness in Hurricanes is costly ". I created a table of the data and highlighted the Harvey row since it is the one that is important on this story. 



**Visual 3:** How does household income impact emergency preparedness? 

This was my favorite visual. As you scroll through the chart you can see how prepared individuals by income bin increase as income increases. 


**Visual 4:** Household Disability Status: Affect of Income on Preparedness

Including this information on household's with disability status was a way to further drive the point that income is a driving factor in a household being prepared. I would think that those with a disability are probably less prepared for a disaster given their physical abilities or financial impact that being disabled can have. However, the data shows that households with a disability status are actually more prepared but when income is considered those that are low-income are less prepared. 


**Visual 5:** How does a educatioal degree affect emergency preparedness?

At one point during this process I noticed that all my visuals were bar charts. Its the visual that worked the best given that I was comparing a binary variable with a categorical variable. I went through all the visuals and challenged myself to think about other ways to clearly represent the data. For education, I decided to use piecharts because the data gaps were big enough for a viewer to be able to see a difference in prepared/unprepared by income category. In the visual you can see how the piechart turns more blue as income increasing, showing that with income there is an increase in households being prepared for a natural disaster. 

Please note: I chose to keep the default blue and red colors from Tablaeu because it fit will with the data red for unprepared and blue for prepared. These two colors are also FEMA's main colors. 


# Final thoughts

I wanted to create a GIS map but the datasets I was worked with fit well with a map. Being a GIS enthusiast that is one of the biggest things I learned. Just because we can make a map of it doesn't mean we need to map it. Another visual might communicate the data better than a map. I learned to choose the visual that is most appropriate in supporting the story I want to tell. 

If I had more time I would have included a map with regions in the 100-yr flood plain and a map of low-income communities. This could support the story that low-income communities are in vulnerable regions. 

I was excited to learn how to build visuals that support a story. I do feel like a gained that from this class. I'll be able to think more critically on the visuals I build for report or presentations. Another big theme of this class is Audience, I learned to think about my audience in my stroyline decision and visual decisions.
