# The final data story

Mind the Gap: Unequal Preparedness in Natural Disaster Planning

# Script 
Before I begin, I want to set the stage. I am a FEMA data analyst, and you are FEMA board members. 

Good afternoon everyone, 

Emergency Declarations: 
Over the last decade, we have seen an increase in FEMA emergency declarations for Hurricanes.  This chart shows that in 2017 alone, there were 2.3 million hurricane declarations. 

With Hurricane season upon us we need to be strategic in our aid approach. 

Case Study: Hurricane Harvey

As seen with Hurricane Harvey. A natural disaster exacerbates the vulnerability of already at-risk populations.
1. Hurricane Harvey increased the homeless population. 
2. Hurricane Harvey led to 125 Billion in damages

Could Texas communities have been more prepared? 

Preparedness: 
Well, our recent FEMA household survey revealed that emergency preparedness gaps are driven by household characteristics such as income and education. 

In this visual, we can see how the number of prepared households increases as income increases. Financially strained households do not have the means to purchase emergency supplies. 


To further drive the point that income is the driving factor. We found that Households with Disability are more likely to be prepared for a natural disaster, but when income is considered, low-income households with disabilities are less prepared. 


Call to action:

A household being prepared can mitigate the effects of being impacted by a natural disaster. 

FEMA could address this problem in 3 ways: increase awareness on being adequately prepared through social media campaigns, host supply drives before seasonal disasters, and provide grants to vulnerable communities to develop programs for their context.
