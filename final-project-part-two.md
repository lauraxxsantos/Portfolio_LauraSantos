Mind the Gap: Unequal Preparedness in Natural Disaster Planning 

The outline: 

1. Executive Summary
    -  Why is this topic important, who it affects and what are the call to actions for FEMA
2. Natural Disaster Rates in the United States
    - Graph with trend of natural disasters in the U.S.
    - describe overall natural disaster trends. Which is more prevalent
3. Impacts of Natural Disasters: Homelessness, Deaths, and Economic Damage
    - Impacts that natural disasters have on people and communities
    - Graph with homelessness rates
    - Graph on deaths
    - Graphs on economic damages (emphasis on costs incurred because preparedness is low)
4. Case Study: Hurricane Harvey
    - emphasize that natural disasters affect more heavily populations that are already vulnerable 
6.  Disparities in Preparedness: Income, Sociodemographically Disadvantaged, Disability
    - Include graphs with disparities that exist within different groups in Income, Sociodemographic status, Disability status
8. Where FEMA Intervenes
    - what is the work FEMA does now
10. Call to Action for further FEMA intervention
    - where FEMA can intervene

# User research 

## Target audience
The audience is FEMA itself, as the leader in the United States emergency management they should be aware of disparities that exist in preparedness. The story is built with FEMA Data, which is a household survey assessing the level of preparedness for each household. FEMA does have this data, so if they reviewed it they would be aware of the disparities. I am going to approach this presentation as if I work for FEMA and I was tasked to analyze the data. This presentation is me presenting the findings to them. 

Another audience member is the federal government and other government officials that can provide funding to FEMA and are responsible in holding FEMA accountable to the people. 


## Interview script
Research Objective: Assess disparities in emergency preparedness across vulnerable populations. Identify points of interventions to increase emergency preparedness.

| Goal | Questions to Ask |
|------|------------------|
| Flag disparities in emergency preparedness that exist among communities to advocate for campaigns that approach emergency preparedness with a culturally-senstive and socioeconomic lens. Different communities may require a different approach.     |   From the title, What do you expect to learn from this webpage?               |
| Raise awareness about community levels of natural disaster preparedness to push for government interventions that increase safety for all U.S. residents.    |   Looking at the layout, Who do you think the audience is?               |
| Determine which natural disasters communities are less aware about ways to prepare or less prepared for.| Given this goal, Is there a visual you think provides the least support to the story? How can we improve that visual?                   |


## Interview findings

| Questions               | Interview 1 (briefly describe) | Interview 2 | Interview 3 |
|-------------------------|--------------------------------|-------------|-------------|
| From the title, What do you expect to learn from this webpage? | Natural disasters in the world. Show how they differ in each country.| Emphasize the need to be prepared for a natural disaster. | Disparities in preparing for a natural disaster. It's just unclear where. |
|  Looking at the layout, Who do you think the audience is?| A legislator |FEMA, to let them know areas of disparities and where they need to do more work. | Government officials or community members|
|  Is there a visual you think provides the least support to the story? How can we improve that visual?|  There is a variety of graph styles which is helpful in showing the skills you have gained. Make these graphs have a cohesive color palette.| A graph about economic impact can be useful. Some data that tells the government the cost incurred when people are least prepared in comparison to cost incurred when people have been support to be prepared. |The area graph with the number of people affected by each natural disaster doesnâ€™t seem to support the story. The numbers seem off. |

|   Title                                       |  adjust or add to the title so it is more clear what context its for and who the audience is                                                                               |
|    Graphs support story                                      |  Find a better dataset on natural disasters in the United states. Less graphs but more quality graphs. Adjust size of graphs.                                                                                |
|  Focus in more on a disaster and audience                                        |     Make the audience FEMA top officials, to set the setting that I am presenting the findings from the household survey report.                                                                             |
