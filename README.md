# About me
I’m Laura Santos, a first-generation Mexican American graduate student at Carnegie Mellon University. I found a passion for data analytics during the last quarter of my bachelor’s degree. Since then, I’ve been on a steady journey to develop my data analytic skills and be equipped with a tool belt for data analysis and visualization. 


While researching immigration policy impacts in San Diego county with Dr. Tom Wong I saw the impact of data analytics in legislation. Dr. Wong emphasized quantitative research as an effective tool in creating change because data can drive government officials to take action. This led me to complete the Data & Policy Certificate at the University of Chicago Harris Public Policy. Data can be misrepresented, leading to ineffective and costly policies that marginalize already vulnerable communities. My drive to learn data analytic tools led to my current enrollment in an Associate in Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Expertise in GIS will further my capability of communicating research findings to stakeholders. I am eager to apply these skills (R, GIS, Python) to provide solutions to pertinent issues in our communities!  


This Fall, I am starting my second year at Heinz College's Master of Science in Public Policy and Management (MSPPM) program. PPM has a rigorous data analytical curriculum that will further my objective to have the skill set to provide innovative solutions to real-world problems.

I have a strong desire to apply my GIS skills to address transnational issues, city planning, remote sensing projects, and risk assessment maps.


# What I hope to Learn: 


1. Leave with a foundational understanding of good visualization practices to create visuals that present data ethically 
2. Learn how to use Tableau to create dashboards 
3. Be able to assess graphics presented in news outlets and research studies critically
