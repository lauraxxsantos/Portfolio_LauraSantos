Did the 2008 U.S. Recession impact Mexico? 

U.S. and Mexico economies are tied together. Family members working in the U.S. send remittances to their loved ones in Mexico. 
In this visualziation I tried to assess the impact of the 2008 reccession in the U.S. to the government debt in Mexico. 
This visualization is a line, which is very distinct from the visual above. With only comparing two countries, the visual I chose was simple but told the story. I chose only two colors in comparison to the above that has a gradient color. The visual above spans 10+ years while my visual focuses on the time frame around the recession. I made sure to only include the data that was relevant.
